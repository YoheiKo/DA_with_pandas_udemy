* My jupyter note studying "Data Analysis with Pandas and Python - Udemy"
* This course is good for learning Pandas. https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/

* Panels method which is covered in section 11 has depreciated. The multi_index_df.ipynb file is not in the original course. This file is what I made from section 11 using multi index dataframe.
