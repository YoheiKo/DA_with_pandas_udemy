### My jupyter notes studying Pandas
* This course is good for learning Pandas. https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/

* Panels method which is covered in section 11 has depreciated. The multi_index_df.ipynb file is not in the original course. This file is what I made from section 11 using multi index dataframe.  

* pandas_rolling_and_bollinger_bands.ipynb is not in the course above. Rolling is important for stock price analysis. I learned throuhg this course: https://www.udemy.com/python-for-finance-and-trading-algorithms/
* I use yahoo finance API instead of a local csv file used in the course
